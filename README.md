# DSA-with-Go
 - Purpose of this repo is to document my journey of learning data structures and algorithms using Golang. Repo is made public to facilitate any and all help it may be of to someone some day.
 - Activities in this repo are currently as part of my 100 days of code journey(Round 1). Focus will be on implementing newly learned data structures and algorithms and solving Leetcode questions.
- I have solved the questions to the best of my knowledge and tried to add unit tests for all questions and implementations.

## Contributing
 - For suggestions related to improving code quality, better approaches to solve the problems, improving tests, errors or mistakes found, please feel free to open an issue.
 - Any and all constructive criticism that would help improve the quality of this repo and me as an engineer, is welcome.
