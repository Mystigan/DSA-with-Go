## [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
 Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

 (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

 Find the minimum element.

 You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
