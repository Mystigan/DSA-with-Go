## [771. Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)
 You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

 The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 ## Constraints
 - S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
 - The characters in J are distinct.

 ### Example 2
