## [1281. Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtract-the-product-and-sum-of-digits-of-an-integer/)
 Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

 ## Constraints
 - 1 <= n <= 10^5
 
 ## Sample input
 ### Example 1
 ```c
 Input: n = 234
 Output: 15 
 Explanation: 
 Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
 Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 
 Result = 24 - 9 = 15
 ```
 ### Example 2
 ```c
 Input: n = 4421
 Output: 21
 Explanation: 
 Product of digits = 4 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 32 
 Sum of digits = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11 
 Result = 32 - 11 = 21
 ```
