## [704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)
 Given a sorted (in ascending order) integer array nums of n elements and a target value, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index, otherwise return -1.

## Constraints
 - You may assume that all elements in nums are unique.
 - n will be in the range [1, 10000].
 - The value of each element in nums will be in the range [-9999, 9999].

 ## Sample input
 ### Example 1
 ```c
 Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
 Output: 4
 Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
 ```
### Example 2
 ```c
 Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
 Output: -1
 Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```
