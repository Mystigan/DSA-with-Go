## [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)
 Implement int sqrt(int x).

 Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

 Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

 ```c
 Input: 4
 Output: 2
 ```
### Example 2
 ```c
 Input: 8
 Output: 2
